It helps you detect and diagnose performance issues, and understand what users actually do with your app. It&#39;s designed for developers, to help you continuously improve the performance and usability of your app. You can find more about Application Insights at [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-insights-overview/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-insights-overview/)
